For example, uppercase A = 65, asterisk (*) = 42, and lowercase k = 107.</p>\n<p>A modern encryption method is to take a text file, convert the bytes to ASCII, then XOR each byte with a given value, taken from a secret key. The advantage with the XOR function is that using the same encryption key on the cipher text, restores the plain text; for example, 65 XOR 42 = 107, then 107 XOR 42 = 65.</p>\n<p>For unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain text message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user would keep the encrypted message and the encryption key in different locations, and without both &quot;halves&quot;, it is impossible to decrypt the message.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this method is impractical for most users, so the modified method is to use a password as a key. If the password is shorter than the message, which is likely, the key is repeated cyclically throughout the message. The balance for this method is using a sufficiently long password key for security, but short enough to be memorable.</p>\n<p>Your task has been made easy, as the encryption key consists of three lower case characters.

The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Fenwick\">Duchy of Grand Fenwick</a>, has a tighter budget, and has asked you (their Royal Programmer) to compute what shape would get best maximum enclosed-area/wall-length ratio.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou have done some preliminary calculations on a sheet of paper.\nFor a 2000 meter wall enclosing the 250 000 m<sup>2</sup> area the\nenclosed-area/wall-length ratio is 125.<br>\nAlthough not allowed , but to get an idea if this is anything better:  if you place a circle inside the square area touching the four sides the area will be equal to &#x3C0;*250<sup>2</sup> m<sup>2</sup> and the perimeter will be &#x3C0;*500 m, so the enclosed-area/wall-length ratio will also be 125.\n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, if you cut off from the square four triangles with sides 75 m, 75 m and 75&#x221A;2 m the total area becomes 238750 m<sup>2</sup> and the perimeter becomes 1400+300&#x221A;2 m. So this gives an enclosed-area/wall-length ratio of 130.87, which is significantly better.\n</p>\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"project/images/p314_landgrab.gif\" alt=\"p314_landgrab.gif\"></div>\n<p>\nFind the maximum enclosed-area/wall-length ratio.<br>\nGive your answer rounded to 8 places behind the decimal point in the form abc.defghijk.\n</p>\n\n\n\n"

Number &quot;<b>8</b>&quot; lights them all.</p>\n\n<p>The clocks consume energy only when segments are turned on/off.<br>\nTo turn on a &quot;<b>2</b>&quot; will cost 5 transitions, while a &quot;<b>7</b>&quot; will cost only 4 transitions.</p>\n\n<p>Sam and Max built two different clocks.</p>\n\n<p>Sam&apos;s clock is fed e.g. number 137: the clock shows &quot;<b>137</b>&quot;, then the panel is turned off, then the next number (&quot;<b>11</b>&quot;) is turned on, then the panel is turned off again and finally the last number (&quot;<b>2</b>&quot;) is turned on and, after some time, off.<br>\nFor the example, with number 137, Sam&apos;s clock requires:<br></p><table><tr><td>&quot;<b>137</b>&quot;</td>\n<td>:</td>\n<td>(2 + 5 + 4) &#xD7; 2 = 22 transitions (&quot;<b>137</b>&quot; on/off).</td>\n</tr><tr><td>&quot;<b>11</b>&quot;</td>\n<td>:</td>\n<td>(2 + 2) &#xD7; 2 = 8 transitions (&quot;<b>11</b>&quot; on/off).</td>\n</tr><tr><td>&quot;<b>2</b>&quot;</td>\n<td>:</td>\n<td>(5) &#xD7; 2 = 10 transitions (&quot;<b>2</b>&quot; on/off).</td>\n</tr></table>\nFor a grand total of 40 transitions.\n\n<p>Max&apos;s clock works differently. Instead of turning off the whole panel, it is smart enough to turn off only those segments that won&apos;t be needed for the next number.<br>\nFor number 137, Max&apos;s clock requires:<br></p><table><tr><td>&quot;<b>137</b>&quot;<br><br></td>\n<td>:<br><br></td>\n<td>2 + 5 + 4 = 11 transitions (&quot;<b>137</b>&quot; on)<br>\n7 transitions (to turn off the segments that are not needed for number &quot;<b>11</b>&quot;).</td>\n</tr><tr><td>&quot;<b>11</b>&quot;<br><br><br></td>\n<td>:<br><br><br></td>\n<td>0 transitions (number &quot;<b>11</b>&quot; is already turned on correctly)<br>\n3 transitions (to turn off the first &quot;<b>1</b>&quot; and the bottom part of the second &quot;<b>1</b>&quot;; <br>\nthe top part is common with number &quot;<b>2</b>&quot;).</td>\n</tr><tr><td>&quot;<b>2</b>&quot;<br><br></td>\n<td>:<br><br></td>\n<td>4 transitions (to turn on the remaining segments in order to get a &quot;<b>2</b>&quot;)<br>\n5 transitions (to turn off number &quot;<b>2</b>&quot;).</td>\n</tr></table>\nFor a grand total of 30 transitions.\n\n<p>Of course, Max&apos;s clock consumes less power than Sam&apos;s one.<br>\nThe two clocks are fed all the prime numbers between A = 10<sup>7</sup> and B = 2&#xD7;10<sup>7</sup>. <br>\nFind the difference between the total number of transitions needed by Sam&apos;s clock and that needed by Max&apos;s one.</p>\n\n"

For example if the angle of repose, $\\alpha = 30$ degrees, and grain is delivered at the centre of the silo then a perfect cone will form towards the top of the cylinder. In the case of this silo, which has a diameter of 6m, the amount of space wasted would be approximately 32.648388556 m<sup>3</sup>.

It would be like knowing that the square is king of the silo, sitting in splendid glory on top of your grain.</p>\n\n<p>Fred&apos;s eyes light up with delight at this elegant resolution, but on closer inspection of Quentin&apos;s drawings and calculations his happiness turns to despondency once more. Fred points out to Quentin that it&apos;s the radius of the silo that is 6 metres, not the diameter, and the angle of repose for his grain is 40 degrees. However, if Quentin can find a set of solutions for this particular silo then he will be more than happy to keep it.</p>\n\n<p>If Quick thinking Quentin is to satisfy frustratingly fussy Fred the farmer&apos;s appetite for all things square then determine the values of $x$ for all possible square space wastage options and calculate $\\sum x$ correct to 9 decimal places.</p>\n"

On examining the drone, they uncovered a device that sought the answer for the so called &quot;<b>Birthday Problem</b>&quot;. The description of the problem was as follows:</p>\n\n<p><i>If people on your planet were to enter a very large room one by one, what will be the expected number of people in the room when you first find <b>3 people with Birthdays within 1 day from each other</b>.</i></p>\n\n<p>The description further instructed them to enter the answer into the device and send the drone into space again. Startled by this turn of events, the Wimwians consulted their best mathematicians. Each year on Wimwi has 10 days and the mathematicians assumed equally likely birthdays and ignored leap years (leap years in Wimwi have 11 days), and found 5.78688636 to be the required answer. As such, the Wimwians entered this answer and sent the drone back into space.</p>\n\n\n<p>After traveling light years away, the drone then landed on planet Joka. The same events ensued except this time, the numbers in the device had changed due to some unknown technical issues.

They too entered the answer into the device and launched the drone into space again.</p>\n\n\n<p>This time the drone landed on planet Earth.

After waiting several hours and receiving no response it is decided to send a team to investigate, of which you are included. Upon entering the vessel you are met by a friendly holographic figure, Katharina, who explains the purpose of the vessel, Eulertopia.</p>\n\n<p>She claims that Eulertopia is almost older than time itself. Its mission was to take advantage of a combination of incredible computational power and vast periods of time to discover the answer to life, the universe, and everything. Hence the resident cleaning robot, Leonhard, along with his housekeeping responsibilities, was built with a powerful computational matrix to ponder the meaning of life as he wanders through a massive 1000 by 1000 square grid of rooms. She goes on to explain that the rooms are numbered sequentially from left to right, row by row. So, for example, if Leonhard was wandering around a 5 by 5 grid then the rooms would be numbered in the following way.</p>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img src=\"project/images/p575_wandering_robot_1_5x5.png\" alt=\"p575_wandering_robot_1_5x5.png\"></div>\n\n<p>Many millenia ago Leonhard reported to Katharina to have found the answer and he is willing to share it with any life form who proves to be worthy of such knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>Katharina further explains that the designers of Leonhard were given instructions to program him with equal probability of remaining in the same room or travelling to an adjacent room. However, it was not clear to them if this meant (i) an equal probability being split equally between remaining in the room and the number of available routes, or, (ii) an equal probability (50%) of remaining in the same room and then the other 50% was to be split equally between the number of available routes.</p>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<table style=\"width:100%;\"><tr><td><img src=\"project/images/p575_wandering_robot_2_fixed.png\" alt=\"p575_wandering_robot_2_fixed.png\"></td>\n<td><img src=\"project/images/p575_wandering_robot_3_dynamic.png\" alt=\"p575_wandering_robot_3_dynamic.png\"></td>\n</tr><tr style=\"font-style:italic;\"><td>(i) Probability of remaining related to number of exits</td>\n<td>(ii) Fixed 50% probability of remaining</td>\n</tr></table></div>\n\n<p>The records indicate that they decided to flip a coin. Heads would mean that the probability of remaining was dynamically related to the number of exits whereas tails would mean that they program Leonhard with a fixed 50% probability of remaining in a particular room. Unfortunately there is no record of the outcome of the coin, so without further information we would need to assume that there is equal probability of either of the choices being implemented.</p>\n\n<p>Katharina suggests it should not be too challenging to determine that the probability of finding him in a square numbered room in a 5 by 5 grid after unfathomable periods of time would be approximately 0.177976190476 [12 d.p.].</p>\n\n<p>In order to prove yourself worthy of visiting the great oracle you must calculate the probability of finding him in a square numbered room in the 1000 by 1000 lair in which he has been wandering.<br>\n(Give your answer rounded to 12 decimal places)</p>\n"

That way, Hilbert could have the generator placed on any given floor (as he likes having the option) and have electricity flow freely throughout the entire hotel.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the contractors misinterpreted the schematics when they built the hotel.
